## Development

### Virtual Env

To set up the development environment, you need to first create a virtual environment with appropriate libraries
To do so, follow these steps:

1. While in the root folder of the project, type `python -m venv env` in the console.
2. Type `.\env\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment.
3. Type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required libraries into the dev environment.
4. Type `pre-commit install` to enable the pre-commit that checks code for correctness and pep 8 compliance
